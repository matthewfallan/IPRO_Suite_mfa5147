You must now specify the Optzyme Groups used in your experiment. An Optzyme
Group is a collection of molecules that is involved in optimization of a given

Molecules are automatically included, at least one Target Molecule must be

1) km - modify binding of the substrate to form the Michaelis complex. One
        Binding Assembly with ground state molecule(s) must be provided. 
2) kcat/km - modify binding of the transition state analogue (TSA). One Binding
             Assembly with the TSA molecule(s) must be provided.
3) kcat - modify a weighted difference of binding affinity between the TSA and
          the substrate. Two Binding Assemblies (one with the substrate(s) and
          one with the TSA molecule(s)) must be provided. Additionally, a
          weighting factor (RT(TSA)/RT(S)) to weight the difference of the two
          binding energies must be included. Thus, the objective function for a
